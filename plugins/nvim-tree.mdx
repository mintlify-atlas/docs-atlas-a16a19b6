## Configuration

The nvim-tree configuration is located at:
```
~/.config/nvim/lua/leyland/plugins/nvim-tree.lua
```

### Current Settings

```lua lua/leyland/plugins/nvim-tree.lua
nvimtree.setup({
  view = {
    width = 50,
    relativenumber = true,
    side = "right",
  },
  renderer = {
    indent_markers = {
      enable = true,
    },
    icons = {
      glyphs = {
        folder = {
          arrow_closed = "",
          arrow_open = "",
        },
      },
    },
  },
  actions = {
    open_file = {
      window_picker = {
        enable = false,
      },
    },
  },
  filters = {
    custom = { ".DS_Store" },
  },
  git = {
    ignore = false,
  },
})
```

### Key Configuration Options

**View Settings:**
- Width: 50 columns
- Position: Right side
- Relative numbers: Enabled

**Display:**
- Indent markers: Enabled (shows tree structure)
- Custom folder icons
- Git status indicators

**Behavior:**
- Window picker: Disabled (opens in current window)
- Shows git ignored files
- Filters `.DS_Store` files

## Customization

### Change Position

To move nvim-tree to the left side:

```lua
view = {
  side = "left",
}
```

### Adjust Width

To change the width:

```lua
view = {
  width = 40, -- or any number
}
```

### Hide Dotfiles by Default

To hide hidden files by default:

```lua
filters = {
  dotfiles = true,
  custom = { ".DS_Store", ".git" },
}
```

<Tip>
You can still toggle hidden files with `H` even if they're hidden by default.
</Tip>

### Custom Keybindings

The `on_attach` function in the config defines custom keybindings:

```lua
local function on_attach(bufnr)
  local api = require("nvim-tree.api")
  
  -- Your custom mappings here
  vim.keymap.set("n", "l", api.node.open.edit, opts("Open"))
  vim.keymap.set("n", "h", api.node.navigate.parent_close, opts("Close Directory"))
end
```

## Git Integration

Nvim-tree shows git status with icons:

| Icon | Status |
|------|--------|
| ✓ | Staged |
| ✗ | Deleted |
| ★ | Modified |
| ✓ | Renamed |
| ➜ | Untracked |
| ✓ | Ignored |

<Note>
Git ignored files are shown by default in nvim-luffy. Toggle them with `I`.
</Note>

## Tips & Tricks

### Quick File Creation Workflow
1. Press `<leader>e` to open nvim-tree
2. Navigate to the directory
3. Press `a` to create a file
4. Start editing immediately

### Using with Telescope
- Use Telescope (`<leader><leader>`) for finding files by name
- Use nvim-tree (`<leader>e`) for browsing structure
- They complement each other perfectly

### Copying File Paths
- `y` - Copy just the filename
- `Y` - Copy relative path (useful for imports)
- `gy` - Copy absolute path (useful for terminal commands)

### Working with Multiple Files
1. Mark files with `m`
2. Perform operations on marked files
3. Clear marks with `m` again

<Tip>
Disabled netrw (Vim's default file explorer) is automatically disabled to prevent conflicts.
