description: "Fuzzy finder for files, text, and more - your primary navigation tool"
---

Telescope is a highly extensible fuzzy finder that serves as the primary navigation tool in nvim-luffy. It provides lightning-fast searching for files, text content, and various other items.

## Overview

Telescope uses fuzzy matching to help you quickly find:
- Files in your project
- Text content across all files
- Recent files
- TODO comments
- Keymaps
- And much more

<Note>
Telescope is configured with the FZF native extension for even faster performance.

## Keymaps

### File Navigation

| Keymap | Description | Command |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| `<leader><leader>` | Find files in current directory | `:Telescope find_files` |
| `<leader>fr` | Find recent files | `:Telescope oldfiles` |

### Text Search

| Keymap | Description | Command |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| `<leader>/` | Live grep (search in files) | `:Telescope live_grep` |
| `<leader>fc` | Find string under cursor | `:Telescope grep_string` |

### Special Searches

| Keymap | Description | Command |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| `<leader>ft` | Find TODO comments | `:TodoTelescope` |
| `<leader>fk` | Browse keymaps | `:Telescope keymaps` |

### Telescope Window Navigation

While in a Telescope window:

| Keymap | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `<C-j>` | Move to next result |
| `<C-k>` | Move to previous result |
| `<C-q>` | Send selected items to quickfix list |
| `<Esc>` | Close Telescope |
| `<Enter>` | Open selected file |

## Usage Examples

### Finding Files

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the file finder">
    Press `<leader><leader>` to open Telescope's file finder.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Type to search">
    Start typing any part of the filename. Telescope uses fuzzy matching, so you don't need to type the exact name.
    
    For example, typing `usrctl` will match `UserController.ts`.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Navigate and open">
    Use `<C-j>` and `<C-k>` to move through results, then press `<Enter>` to open the file.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Searching Text Content

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open live grep">
    Press `<leader>/` to search for text across all files in your project.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Type your search term">
    Enter the text you're looking for. Results update in real-time as you type.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Review results">
    Telescope shows the filename, line number, and matching line for each result.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
To search for the word under your cursor, use `<leader>fc` instead of typing it manually.
</Tip>

### Finding TODOs

Press `<leader>ft` to search for all TODO, HACK, WARN, PERF, NOTE, and FIX comments in your project.

```lua
-- TODO: Implement this feature
-- HACK: Temporary workaround
-- WARN: This might cause issues
-- PERF: Optimize this section
-- NOTE: Important information
-- FIX: Bug that needs fixing
```

### Browsing Keymaps

Press `<leader>fk` to see all available keymaps. This is incredibly useful when learning nvim-luffy.

## Configuration

The Telescope configuration is located at:
```
~/.config/nvim/lua/leyland/plugins/telescope.lua
```

### Current Settings

```lua lua/leyland/plugins/telescope.lua
telescope.setup({
  defaults = {
    path_display = { "filename_first" },
    mappings = {
      i = {
        ["<C-k>"] = actions.move_selection_previous,
        ["<C-j>"] = actions.move_selection_next,
        ["<C-q>"] = actions.send_selected_to_qflist + actions.open_qflist,
      },
    },
  },
  pickers = {
    live_grep = {
      path_display = { "truncate" },
    },
  },
})
```

### Dependencies

Telescope requires the following plugins:
- `plenary.nvim` - Core Lua functions
- `telescope-fzf-native.nvim` - FZF algorithm for faster performance
- `nvim-web-devicons` - File icons
- `todo-comments.nvim` - TODO comment integration

## Customization

### Adding Custom Pickers

You can add your own Telescope pickers. Add this to your configuration:

```lua
keymap.set("n", "<leader>fb", "<cmd>Telescope buffers<cr>", { desc = "Find buffers" })
```

### Changing Display Options

To change how paths are displayed:

```lua
defaults = {
  path_display = { "smart" }, -- Options: "smart", "truncate", "filename_first"
}
```

### Adding More Search Locations

To search in specific directories:

```lua
keymap.set("n", "<leader>fc", function()
  require('telescope.builtin').find_files({
    cwd = "~/.config"
  })
end, { desc = "Find config files" })
```

<Tip>
Telescope has many more built-in pickers. Run `:Telescope` without arguments to see all available options.
</Tip>

## Tips & Tricks

### Fast Navigation
- Use fuzzy matching: type key letters instead of the full name
- Example: `usco` matches `UserController.js`

### Combining with Quickfix
- Select multiple items in Telescope with `<Tab>`
- Send them to quickfix with `<C-q>`
- Navigate through them with `:cnext` and `:cprev`

### Recent Files
- `<leader>fr` shows your file history
- Great for jumping back to files you worked on earlier

### Search and Replace
1. Use `<leader>/` to find all occurrences
2. Send to quickfix with `<C-q>`
3. Use `:cdo s/old/new/g | update` to replace in all files

<Note>
Telescope respects your `.gitignore` file and won't search ignored files by default.
