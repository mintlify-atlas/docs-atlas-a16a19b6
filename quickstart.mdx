# Quick Start Guide

This guide will get you productive with nvim-luffy in just 5 minutes. We'll cover the essential keymaps and workflows you need to start coding.

<Note>
  The leader key is `Space`. When you see `<leader>`, press the Space bar.

## Your First Workflow

<Steps>

<Step title="Open your project">
  Launch Neovim in your project directory:

  ```bash
  cd ~/my-project
  nvim
  ```

  You'll see the Luffy dashboard. Press `f` to find files or `q` to quit.
</Step>

<Step title="Find and open a file">
  Press `<leader><leader>` (Space twice) to open the file finder.
  
  - Type part of the filename
  - Use `<C-j>` / `<C-k>` to navigate results
  - Press `Enter` to open the file

  <Tip>
    The file finder is fuzzy - you don't need to type the exact name. "usrctl" will match "UserController.ts".
  </Tip>
</Step>

<Step title="Navigate your code">
  With a file open:
  
  - Hover over a function and press `K` to see its documentation
  - Press `gd` to jump to its definition
  - Press `gr` to see all places it's used
  - Press `<C-o>` to jump back

  <Info>
    LSP features work automatically for supported languages once Mason finishes installing language servers.
  </Info>
</Step>

<Step title="Search across your project">
  Press `<leader>/` to search for text in all files.
  
  - Type your search term
  - Use `<C-j>` / `<C-k>` to navigate results
  - Press `Enter` to jump to that location
  - Press `<C-q>` to send results to quickfix list
</Step>

<Step title="Mark your important files with Harpoon">
  Open a file you work with frequently, then press `<leader>H` to mark it.
  
  Repeat for up to 9 files. Now you can:
  - Press `<leader>1` to jump to your first marked file
  - Press `<leader>2` for the second, etc.
  - Press `<leader>h` to see all marked files

  <Tip>
    Harpoon is perfect for switching between related files like "routes.ts", "controller.ts", and "test.ts".
  </Tip>
</Step>

<Step title="Browse files with the tree">
  Press `<leader>e` to toggle the file explorer on the right side.
  
  In the tree:
  - `l` to open a file/folder
  - `h` to close a folder
  - `a` to create a file
  - `d` to delete
  - `r` to rename
  - `c` to copy, `p` to paste

  Press `<leader>e` again to close the tree.
</Step>

</Steps>

## Pro Tips

### Auto-completion

As you type, nvim-cmp will suggest completions:

- `<C-j>` / `<C-k>` - Navigate suggestions
- `<Tab>` - Accept and jump to next snippet field
- `<Enter>` - Accept suggestion
- `<C-e>` - Close completion menu
- `<C-Space>` - Trigger completion manually

### Code Formatting

Files are formatted automatically on save. To format manually:

```vim
<leader>mp
```

Supported formatters:
- **JavaScript/TypeScript**: prettier
- **Lua**: stylua  
- **Python**: black + isort
- **CSS/HTML/JSON**: prettier

### Quick Actions

- **Fix import**: Place cursor on an undefined symbol, press `<leader>ca`, select "Add import"
- **Organize imports**: `<leader>ca` → "Organize imports"
- **Quick fix**: Press `<leader>ca` on any error for suggested fixes

### Using Flash for Navigation

Flash provides lightning-fast cursor movement:

- `s<char>` - Jump to any visible character
- `S<char>` - Jump to any visible word
- Type the highlighted letter to jump

### Git Workflow

<Steps>

<Step title="Make changes">
  Edit your files as normal. Format on save is enabled.
</Step>

<Step title="Review changes">
  Press `<leader>gg` to open Neogit. You'll see:
  - Unstaged changes
  - Staged changes  
  - Recent commits
</Step>

<Step title="Stage and commit">
  In Neogit:
  - `s` to stage a file
  - `u` to unstage
  - `c` to commit
  - Type your message and save (`:wq`)
</Step>

<Step title="View diffs">
  Press `<leader>dd` to see a side-by-side diff of your changes.
</Step>

</Steps>
