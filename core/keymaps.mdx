# Keymaps

This page documents all custom keymaps configured in `lua/leyland/core/keymaps.lua`. These keybindings enhance productivity and provide intuitive shortcuts for common operations.

## Leader Key

```lua
vim.g.mapleader = " "
```

The leader key is set to **Space**. The leader key acts as a prefix for custom commands, preventing conflicts with Neovim's built-in keybindings.

<Note>
This must be set before any keymaps that use `<leader>` are defined, otherwise those keymaps will use the default leader key (backslash).
</Note>

## Window Management

These keymaps provide quick access to window splitting and management operations.

### Window Splitting

| Keymap | Mode | Action | Description |
|--------|------|--------|-------------|
| `<leader>\|` | Normal | `<C-w>v` | Split window vertically |
| `<leader>sh` | Normal | `<C-w>s` | Split window horizontally |

<Accordion title="Why these keybindings?">

The vertical split uses the pipe character (`|`) which visually represents a vertical division, making it intuitive to remember. The horizontal split uses `sh` (split horizontal) for clarity.

These are more memorable than the default Vim commands:
- Default vertical split: `<C-w>v`
- Default horizontal split: `<C-w>s`

With these keymaps, you can simply think: **Space + | = vertical split**

</Accordion>

**Example workflow:**

```lua
-- 1. Open a file
-- 2. Press <Space>| to create a vertical split
-- 3. Press <Space>sh to create a horizontal split
```

<CodeGroup>

```lua Vertical Split
keymap.set("n", "<leader>|", "<C-w>v", { desc = "Split window vertically" })
```

```lua Horizontal Split
keymap.set("n", "<leader>sh", "<C-w>s", { desc = "Split window horizontally" })
```

</CodeGroup>

## Buffer Management

Buffer management keymaps provide quick ways to close buffers without affecting window layouts.

| Keymap | Mode | Command | Description |
|--------|------|---------|-------------|
| `<leader>bd` | Normal | `:bd<CR>` | Close current buffer |
| `<leader>ba` | Normal | `:%bd<CR>` | Close all buffers |

<Accordion title="Understanding Buffers vs Windows">

**Buffers** are in-memory text representations of files. You can have multiple buffers open while only viewing some in windows.

**Windows** are viewports that display buffers.

- `:bd` (buffer delete) closes the buffer but keeps the window layout intact
- `:%bd` closes all buffers at once

These keymaps use mnemonic prefixes:
- `bd` = **B**uffer **D**elete
- `ba` = **B**uffer **A**ll (delete all)

</Accordion>

<CodeGroup>

```lua Close Current Buffer
keymap.set("n", "<leader>bd", "<cmd>bd<CR>", { desc = "Close buffer" })
```

```lua Close All Buffers
keymap.set("n", "<leader>ba", "<cmd>%bd<CR>", { desc = "Close all buffers" })
```

</CodeGroup>

<Tip>
Use `<leader>bd` when you want to close a file but keep your window layout. The window remains open and will display the alternate buffer.
</Tip>

## Commented Out Keymaps

The configuration file includes some commented-out keymaps that you might want to enable:

### Quick Escape from Insert Mode

```lua
-- keymap.set("i", "jk", "<ESC>", {desc = "Exit Insert mode with jk"})
```

This popular keymap allows you to press `j` then `k` quickly in insert mode to return to normal mode, avoiding the reach to the Escape key.

<Note>
**Why it's commented out:** This can interfere if you actually need to type "jk" in sequence. If you enable it, you'll need to type slowly when "jk" appears in natural text.
</Note>

### Clear Search Highlights

```lua
-- keymap.set("n", "<leader>nh", ":nohl<CR>", { desc = "Clear search highlights" })
```

Clears search highlighting after you're done searching.

<Note>
**Why it's commented out:** This configuration uses an autocommand to automatically clear search highlights (see autocommands.mdx), making a manual keymap redundant.
</Note>

## Keymap Structure

All keymaps follow this structure:

```lua
vim.keymap.set(mode, key, action, options)
```

- **mode**: The mode where the keymap is active (`"n"` = normal, `"i"` = insert, `"v"` = visual)
- **key**: The key combination to trigger the action
- **action**: The command or key sequence to execute
- **options**: A table with additional options:
  - `desc`: Description shown in which-key and other keymap viewers

## Navigation Tips

<Accordion title="Window Navigation (Built-in)">

While not defined in this file, here are essential built-in window navigation commands:

| Keymap | Action |
|--------|--------|
| `<C-w>h` | Move to left window |
| `<C-w>j` | Move to window below |
| `<C-w>k` | Move to window above |
| `<C-w>l` | Move to right window |
| `<C-w>w` | Cycle through windows |
| `<C-w>q` | Close current window |

</Accordion>

## Summary

The keymap configuration prioritizes:
- **Mnemonic keybindings**: Easy to remember (e.g., `bd` = buffer delete)
- **Leader key organization**: All custom keymaps use Space as leader
- **Visual consistency**: Pipe character for vertical splits
- **Buffer management**: Clean ways to close buffers without disrupting layout
- **Minimal but effective**: Only includes essential keymaps, relying on plugins for advanced functionality
